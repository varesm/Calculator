To see how the project works, pull it, build it, and run the WebAPI project on your local machine.

The documentation is implemented using Swagger, so you can see how the API works by entering this address in your browser (after running the WebAPI project and if it doesn't show up automatically): https://localhost:7262/swagger/index.html
